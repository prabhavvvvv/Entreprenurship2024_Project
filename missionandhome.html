  <h2 class="mission">OUR MISSION</h2>
  <p>We have the important mission to connect passionate people to meaningful volunteering opportunities tailored for them. Our platform strives to match future volunteers with organizations based on their interests and the way they want to serve their community. This organization plans to mutually support the organizations and the people searching for the perfect opportunity to volunteer for. Through our user-friendly page, we aim to make volunteering opportunities a much more painless and accessible process for kids, teens and adults. This is open all throughout the Bay Area and we encourage everyone to use this.
